PART 1 - PLAYER COMPONENTS

Used a Layout component, instead of App,  to houseall the components... at this stage

If a component had sub-components it got a folder. Players, Player, PlayeEdit, PlayerAdd

Split Add & Edit as found it easier to build and easier to debug on error.

Used Materialize for layout and css
